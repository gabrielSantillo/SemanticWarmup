    <h2>Palmeiras's History</h2>

    <p><strong>Foundation and early exploits</strong></p>
    <p>As the game of football was starting to take hold in Brazil, a group of young Italians decided to start their own club. The main idea was to form a club that would represent the Italian community. In 1914, 46 interested individuals formed the club under the name of Palestra Italia. They played their first official game in the city o Votorantim, beating Savoy 2-0. Two years later, they joined the official SÃ£o Paulo State Championship.</p>

     <p>In 1917, Palmeiras faced Corinthians for the first time, laying the foundation for one of the greatest rivalries in Brazilian football. Much to the chagrin of Corinthians fans, Palmeiras won the initial two games 3-0 and 3-1. Soon thereafter, the club moved to the Palestra Italia Stadium, which would be their home until 2010.</p>
